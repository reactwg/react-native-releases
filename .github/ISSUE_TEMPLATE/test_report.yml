        ## Test Report
        Test reports are used to evaluate new React Native releases across a number of test configurations. They serve as logged summaries, jumping off points for regression investigations, and generally as a structured validation. Generally, these Test Reports are filled out by Release Crew members. Note: This is not the correct form to report generic issues or upgrade regressions. Start at https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/new/choose for those.
