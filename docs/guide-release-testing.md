# Release Testing

Release testing is manual testing the release crew does to sanity check that our new releases build and run and don't regress core experiences.

> [!Important]
> Make sure you have the right access/tokens set up. See [onboarding](./roles-and-responsibilities.md#onboarding-to-release-crew).

> [!Caution]
> Currently, this flow can only be done on macOS machines.

> [!Note]
> In most cases we should have 2 release crew members running release testing, on two separate machines.

## Checkout the version to test

When testing locally, first checkout and pull from the stable branch for the version you wish to test. For example, if testing 0.75.x:

1. `git checkout 0.75-stable`
2. `git pull`

## Clean up the local state

When testing locally, we want to ensure that we start from a clean slate to avoid caches polluting our testing.

1. Delete `RNTester` and `RNTestProject` from your Android emulator and iOS simulator if leftover from previous test.
2. Remove any temporary files from the `react-native` repo:

   ```bash
    yarn test-e2e-local-clean
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
    yarn install
   ```

## Generating projects to test

We test on two apps

- `RNTester`, a demonstration app that higlights the APIs and core components of React Native
- `RNTestProject`, a project built from the React Native [template]()

| App           | New Architecture enabled |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| RNTester      | true                     |
| RNTestProject | false                    |

> [!Note]
> If you need to enable New Architecture on `RNTestProject`, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/blob/main/docs/enable-apps.md#enable-the-new-architecture-for-apps).

To generate the the right project with the specific configuration desired, you can use the command:

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local [options]
```

Followed by the options:

```bash
  --help          Show help                                            [boolean]
  --version       Show version number                                  [boolean]
  -t, --target      [choices: "RNTester", "RNTestProject"] [default: "RNTester"]
  -p, --platform                    [choices: "iOS", "Android"] [default: "iOS"]
  -h, --hermes                                         [boolean] [default: true]
  -c, --ciToken                                                         [string]
```

Using the `-c <your-token>` option is recommended, as the script will download the required artifacts from Github, instead of having to build from source reducing the testing time. It's suggested to store your [Github Personal Access Token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#personal-access-tokens-classic) using:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<token>
```

> [!Warning]
> If you are testing versions of React Native that are < 0.75, you need a CircleCI token rather than a Github Token.
> Follow [these instruction](https://circleci.com/docs/managing-api-tokens/) to learn how to create one.

Use [this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=React%20Native%20Releases&scopes=repo) to generate a token with the Repo scope.

There are a couple of extra requirements to make this flow work:

1. the CI must have run at least once in the current branch. We need to download artifacts generated by Github, so we need to have at least one run of the CI.
2. The relevant jobs must have been finished. The required jobs depends on the task you are about to test:
   - if you are testing RNTester on iOS, it has to download Hermes for iOS. So the job that produces it must have finished successfully
   - if you are testing RNTester on Android, it has to download the right APK (JSC or Hermes). So the job that produces the APKs must have finished successfully.
   - if you are testing RNTestProject, it has to download the maven prebuilts and the Hermes engine for iOS. So the jobs that produce those artifacts must have finished successfully.

If any of those prerequisites is not met, the script should output a proper error message.

> [!Warning]
> CI artifacts are only taken from the _last_ commit. This means everytime you push to your release branch, you'll have to wait for the artifacts to build again. You cannot release test using artifacts from an "older" commit. Plan accordingly.

If you need to build React Native from source, you can skip the `-c` parameter. By not passing the Github token, the script falls back to the previous flow, building everything locally.

## Dimensions to test

Here are the 8 dimensions we cover in manual testing:

**1. RNTester + iOS + Hermes:**

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTester" -p "iOS" -h true -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**2. RNTester + iOS + JSC:**

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTester" -p "iOS" -h false -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**3. RNTester + Android + Hermes:**

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTester" -p "Android" -h true -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**4. RNTester + Android + JSC:**

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTester" -p "Android" -h false -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**5. RNTestProject + iOS + Hermes:**

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTestProject" -p "iOS" -h true -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**6. RNTestProject + iOS + JSC:**

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTestProject" -p "iOS" -h false -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**7. RNTestProject + Android + Hermes:**

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTestProject" -p "Android" -h true -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**8. RNTestProject + Android + JSC:**

```bash
yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTestProject" -p "Android" -h false -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

## What to test?

- Depending on the nature of what is being picked in, you may only test very specific workflows.
- At Meta, we have internal e2e tests but they don't capture interactive capabilities or developer experience workflows.
- General rule of thumb is to prioritize
  - debugging
  - developer menu
  - TextInput
  - Lists
  - Keyboard interactions

## How to test?

1. Create a [Test Report](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Test+Report&projects=&template=test_report.yml)
2. Fill out the table of test dimensions
3. Refer to the [spreadsheet of test cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p0Zs37ecau7Ty4L_4g1jf7PlivOmIEPjmDYq9Jp8qWI/edit?usp=sharing), make any outstanding notes in the Test Report
4. Close the Test Report issue if the release passes testing

### Recommended Sequence for testing

> [!Tip]
> Make sure the remote assets are built on your release branch to use the `-c` option (highly recommended)

```bash
react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local-clean # alias this command to make your life easier to something like "clean"

# RNTester

react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTester" -p "iOS" --hermes true -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
# verify tests "what to test"
# kill metro
xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.meta.RNTester.localDevelopment # delete RNTester from your iOS simulator

react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTester" -p "iOS" --hermes false -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
# verify tests "what to test"
# kill metro
xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.meta.RNTester.localDevelopment # delete RNTester from your iOS simulator

react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTester" -p "Android" --hermes true -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
# verify tests "what to test"
# kill metro
adb uninstall com.facebook.react.uiapp # delete RNTester from your Android emulator

react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTester" -p "Android" --hermes false -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
# verify tests "what to test"
# kill metro
adb uninstall com.facebook.react.uiapp # delete RNTester from your Android emulator

# RNTestProject

react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTestProject" -p "iOS" --hermes true -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
# verify tests "what to test"
# kill metro
xcrun simctl uninstall booted org.reactjs.native.example.RNTestProject # delete RNTestProject from your iOS simulator

react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTestProject" -p "iOS" --hermes false -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
# verify tests "what to test"
# kill metro
xcrun simctl uninstall booted org.reactjs.native.example.RNTestProject # delete RNTestProject from your iOS simulator

react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTestProject" -p "Android" --hermes true -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
# verify tests "what to test"
# kill metro
adb uninstall com.rntestproject # delete RNTestProject from your Android emulator

react-native$ yarn test-e2e-local -t "RNTestProject" -p "Android" --hermes false -c $GITHUB_TOKEN
# verify tests "what to test"
# kill metro
adb uninstall com.rntestproject # delete RNTestProject from your Android emulator
```

## Versions older than 71

You need to use the interactive script run you through the different variants in [Test Dimensions](#dimensions-to-test):

```bash
./scripts/test-manual-e2e.sh
```

This script will ask you to select which platform and which project you want to test, and then to execute a series of extra steps during the process. Bear in mind, when testing RNTester on Android, you need to start the Android emulator ahead of time or it will fail.
